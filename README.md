# WhatsApp Clone

Clone site of the WhatsApp login page.

## Project aims

To produce a semi-functional frontpage of WhatsApp to practice and improve HTML, CSS & JS knowledge and skills and to expand knowledge range through the challenges faced in replicating the site.

It is not intended to link to WhatsApp and isn't responsive so should only reliably render on desktops.
